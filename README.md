### Summary:
- My favorite task is to captain hi-loaded cloud environments with a fully automated Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
- With 15+ years of professional experience in the software development industry.
- I am responsible for designing, building, and maintaining highly reliable and scalable systems. 
- My daily routine is to improve system reliability, performance, and efficiency. 

### Skills:
- Managing all my cloud environments as a code with Terraform and Github.
- Release engineering and Code delivery that involves managing the software release process, from planning and development to deployment and monitoring. I automated with Jenkins Pipelines.
- Emphasizing controlled and well-tested changes to minimize the risk of outages. Also, I implement and promote canary deployments and rollbacks to reduce the impact of changes.
- Creating CI/CD pipelines for building, testing, and deploying software changes into Kubernetes clusters to ensure code changes were thoroughly tested and validated on development cloud environments before being released to production.
- Using observability systems to track the performance and availability of software applications in production. Monitoring tools allowed me to quickly detect and respond to issues before they significantly impact users.
- Working with historical usage patterns and future growth projections to ensure that systems have sufficient capacity to handle expected traffic, and I also perform load testing and capacity experiments to validate my assumptions.
- Analyzing system performance, identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement. I work closely with development teams to optimize code, configurations, and infrastructure to enhance performance and scalability.
- Focusing on effective incident management by defining transparent processes and escalation paths. When incidents occur, I respond quickly, conduct post-incident reviews, and implement preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents.
- Automating to minimize manual toil and increase efficiency. Automation helps with deployment, configuration management, monitoring, and incident response tasks.
- Managing the configurations of servers and other infrastructure components. I automated deploying and configuring services to reduce the risk of configuration errors.
- Collaborating with development teams to establish efficient deployment and release processes. I ensure proper version control, configuration management, and release strategies, aiming for seamless and reliable deployments.
- During daily meetings with the teams, I effectively communicated with stakeholders to ensure that everyone was aware of the current issues and state and the steps being taken to resolve them. This involved status updates, incident reports, or direct communication with the microservices owners.
- A significant part of my responsibility included creating comprehensive documentation and conducting.

### Experience and Achievements:
- Experienced in migration of microservices web applications from dedicated data centers to a public cloud environment.
- Implementation of DevOps practices and tools to automate the software delivery process.
- Focused on Amazon Web Services Platform Solutions: AWS ECS, AWS EKS, AWS OpenSearch, AWS RDS.
- Coding/Scripting: read and write in Python and Bash.
- Operation experience Solaris / Linux.
- Knowledge and experience in Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Systems.
- Microservices Architecture / Development.
- Manager skills: Team Leader and Mentor.
- Experience in Agile Methodologies.

### Education:
- Master's Degree in Informatics and Computer Sciences, National Technical University of Ukraine "Kyiv Polytechnic Institute," Kyiv, Ukraine.
- Bachelor's Degree in Computer Sciences, International Scientific Technical University, Kyiv, Ukraine.
